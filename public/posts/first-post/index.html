  <p>Glad and very happy to be writing this post. It marks a comeback in many aspects of life: professional, personal&hellip; spiritual, maybe?</p>
<p>This summer started with an announcement: I am back at tecRacer, working as Cloud Consultant (that is, solutions architect) after two and a half years from resigning this position. All this time away from consulting led me to a place where confort was in place, but it somehow missed the growth that I was looking for when I left. Under new investment, brand and development roadmap, the firm looks to a brighter future ahead. And I&rsquo;m quite honored to be part during this crucial moment.</p>
<p>Onboarding occurred during the company&rsquo;s yearly meeting in Hamburg, which was held concurrently to the AWS Summit. We had a pre-Summit party at GAGA Club along many partners and colleagues - odd enough, the club was a good opportunity to catch up with people I missed while being a remote engineer.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/first-post/0L8A0309.jpg" alt="This smile can&rsquo;t hide how happy I was"></p>
<p>While in Hamburg, I also attended two interesting AWS Experience workshops: one about Amazon VPC Lattice, at Public Cloud Group, and another about Karpenter, at Storm Reply. Two and a half years away, on the cloud computing business, seems like a lot when you&rsquo;re catching up.</p>
<p>The Summit itself was awesome, nothing different from the high standard AWS sets on their events. I could definitely feel the shift to AI that our market is heading to. GenAI is a reality.</p>
<p>Another comeback this summer reserved me is hunting for certifications. A couple weeks ago, I earned the AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate. Nothing too difficult to someone already in the business, but this one wasn&rsquo;t under my belt yet and I needed to warm up before renewing my Associate Solutions Architect certificate (expired this year). Regardless of difficulty, I had to save some time to study and prepare for the exam. That never changes.</p>
