      <description>&lt;p&gt;Glad and very happy to be writing this post. It marks a comeback in many aspects of life: professional, personal&amp;hellip; spiritual, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This summer started with an announcement: I am back at tecRacer, working as Cloud Consultant (that is, solutions architect) after two and a half years from resigning this position. All this time away from consulting led me to a place where confort was in place, but it somehow missed the growth that I was looking for when I left. Under new investment, brand and development roadmap, the firm looks to a brighter future ahead. And I&amp;rsquo;m quite honored to be part during this crucial moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
