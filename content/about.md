**Luiz Ferreira** (A.K.A. Lizfer) is a **Solutions Architect** with emphasis in **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** cloud consultancy. With a broad expertise in Linux container orchestration, observability, networking and scaling (using **Kubernetes**), this author writes about **infrastructure-as-code**, migration to the cloud, tech certifications and other **DevOps / Site Reliability Engineering** topics in this blog.

Brazilian born ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, Portugal based ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, works over a decade with technology, call-centers, translation and agile methodologies, and holds academic degrees in marketing and software engineering - a blend of technical depth with strategic perspective. 

Beyond the cloud, you'll find him goalkeeping, taking care of his mango bonsai, playing guitar (art doesn't need to be elitistly technical, or in other words: it's okay to suck), trainspotting and road tripping.
