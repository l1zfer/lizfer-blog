Glad and very happy to be writing this post. It marks a comeback in many aspects of life: professional, personal... spiritual, maybe?

### Back to consulting

This summer started with an announcement: I am back at <a href="https://tecracer.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**tecRacer**</a>, working as **Cloud Consultant** (that is, solutions architect) after two and a half years from resigning this position. All this time away from consulting led me to a place where comfort was in place, but it somehow missed the growth that I was looking for when I left. 

Under new investment, brand and development roadmap, the firm looks to a brighter future ahead. And I'm quite honored to be part during this crucial moment - there's something energizing about being part of a transformation story.

### Hamburg adventures

Onboarding occurred during the **company's yearly meeting in Hamburg**, which was held concurrently with the **AWS Summit**. We had a pre-Summit party at <a href="https://www.ga-ga.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAGA Club</a> along with many partners and colleagues - odd enough, the club was a good opportunity to catch up with people I missed while being a remote engineer.

While in Hamburg, I also attended two interesting **AWS Experience** workshops: one about <a href="https://aws-experience.com/emea/de-central-growth/e/0d6f7/net01---amazon-vpc-lattice-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon VPC Lattice, at Public Cloud Group</a>, and another about <a href="https://aws-experience.com/emea/de-central-growth/e/794cd/mod06---karpenter-amazon-eks-best-practice-and-cloud-cost-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karpenter, at Storm Reply</a>. 

Two and a half years away from the cloud computing business seems like a lot when you're catching up. Those HouseWarming Hamburg sessions were spread all over the city and attending them was actually a recommendation by <a href="https://vidicorner.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my friend Vidi</a> (check his blog!) - I'm glad I had to shadow him on those sessions, because he's into Kubernetes the same as I am. 

### AWS Summit impressions

The Summit itself was awesome, nothing different from the high standard AWS sets on their events. I could definitely feel the shift to AI that our market is heading to. **GenAI is a reality**, and it's reshaping how we think about cloud architecture and solutions.

What struck me most was how democratized AI tools have become. Every booth, every session, every conversation somehow touched on machine learning, generative AI, or intelligent automation. It's no longer a "nice to have" - it's becoming the baseline expectation.

### The certification hunt

Another comeback this summer reserved me is hunting for certifications. A couple weeks ago, I earned the **AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate**. Nothing too difficult to someone already in the business, but this one wasn't under my belt yet and I needed to warm up before renewing my Associate Solutions Architect certificate (expired this year). 

Regardless of difficulty, I had to save some time to study and prepare for the exam. That never changes.

### Looking forward

This comeback feels different from previous career moves. There's a sense of purpose, of being at the right place at the right time. The cloud industry is maturing, AI is reshaping everything, and I'm back in the consulting game with fresh eyes and renewed energy.

More posts to come about technical deep-dives, certification journeys, and lessons learned in the field. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
