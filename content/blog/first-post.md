Glad and very happy to be writing this post. It marks a comeback in many aspects of life: professional, personal... spiritual, maybe?

This summer started with an announcement: I am back at tecRacer, working as Cloud Consultant (that is, solutions architect) after two and a half years from resigning this position. All this time away from consulting led me to a place where confort was in place, but it somehow missed the growth that I was looking for when I left. Under new investment, brand and development roadmap, the firm looks to a brighter future ahead. And I'm quite honored to be part during this crucial moment.

Onboarding occurred during the company's yearly meeting in Hamburg, which was held concurrently to the AWS Summit. We had a pre-Summit party at GAGA Club along many partners and colleagues - odd enough, the club was a good opportunity to catch up with people I missed while being a remote engineer.

While in Hamburg, I also attended two interesting AWS Experience workshops: one about Amazon VPC Lattice, at Public Cloud Group, and another about Karpenter, at Storm Reply. Two and a half years away, on the cloud computing business, seems like a lot when you're catching up.

The Summit itself was awesome, nothing different from the high standard AWS sets on their events. I could definitely feel the shift to AI that our market is heading to. GenAI is a reality.

Another comeback this summer reserved me is hunting for certifications. A couple weeks ago, I earned the AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate. Nothing too difficult to someone already in the business, but this one wasn't under my belt yet and I needed to warm up before renewing my Associate Solutions Architect certificate (expired this year). Regardless of difficulty, I had to save some time to study and prepare for the exam. That never changes.
